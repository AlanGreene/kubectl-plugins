This plugin was setup for internal use but it shouldn't take much to modify it for your own use. Start by changing the namespace values to the namespaces you use in your environment (we use staging, preprod, prod, etc).
You'll also want to edit the Docker Registry value (the example uses nexus.myOrg.com) with your own registry or leave it blank to search docker hub.
